# Fictional Calendar Configuration
calendar:
  # The fictional start date used when the server starts for the first time.
  # This date is used to initialize the calendar if 'day', 'month', or 'year' are not explicitly set below, or if 'lastUpdate' is 0.
  # Format: "dd-mm-yyyy" (day-month-year).
  start-date: "01-01-1000"

  # The last real-world time (in milliseconds) when the calendar was updated by the plugin's internal tick.
  # This value is crucial for calculating how many fictional days have passed since the last update.
  # Do NOT modify this value manually unless you know exactly what you are doing, as it can cause date desynchronization.
  # If you are manually setting the 'day', 'month', or 'year' below, it is recommended to set this to 0 or remove it,
  # so the plugin recalculates the 'lastUpdate' on startup.
  lastUpdate: 0

  # The current fictional date settings. These values represent the plugin's active date.
  # The plugin will automatically update these values based on the 'days-per-irl-day' setting.
  day: 1        # Day of the current fictional month (must be 1 to the number of days specified in 'days-per-month' in plugin logic).
  month: 1      # Month number (must be 1 to the total number of months defined in 'month-names' list below).
  year: 1000    # Fictional year (must be a positive integer).

  # Number of fictional days that pass for every one real-life day.
  # For example, a value of 3.0 means 3 fictional days will pass for every 24 real-life hours.
  # Fractional values are allowed (e.g., 0.5 for half a fictional day per real day).
  # I strongly recommend to leave it as is if you are satisfied with the current progression speed.
  days-per-irl-day: 3.0

  # The primary format for displaying the date in chat commands (e.g., /fc date) and some PAPI placeholders.
  # You can customize this string using placeholders:
  #   - dd: Day (e.g., 01, 15, 30)
  #   - mm: Month number (e.g., 01, 06, 12)
  #   - MM: Month name (e.g., Love, Chaos, Evil)
  #   - yyyy: Year (e.g., 1000, 1999, 2025)
  #   - ww: Weekday name (e.g., Anth, Sil, Theyim)
  # Examples:
  #   "dd-mm-yyyy" -> 01-01-1000
  #   "mm/dd/yyyy" -> 01/01/1000
  #   "MM dd, yyyy" -> Love 01, 1000
  #   "dd of MM, yyyy (ww)" -> 01 of Love, 1000 (Anth)
  date-format: "dd-mm-yyyy"

  # The default style for date output when using the /fc date command without specifying 'short' or 'long'.
  #   - "short": Displays only the date according to 'date-format'.
  #   - "long": Displays the date according to 'date-format' and appends the weekday name (if not already included with 'ww').
  date-style: "short"

  # Whether months should be displayed as their text names or as numbers.
  # This affects how 'mm' and 'MM' are interpreted in 'date-format' and also influences PAPI output for month.
  #   - "text": Displays month names from the 'month-names' list (e.g., Love, Chaos).
  #   - "numeric": Displays month numbers (e.g., 1, 6, 12).
  month-format: "text"

  # List of month names used in your fictional calendar.
  # The total number of months in your calendar is determined by the number of items in this list.
  # Months are indexed starting from 1 (e.g., the first name in the list is Month 1, the second is Month 2, etc.).
  month-names:
    - Love
    - Power
    - Order
    - Knowledge
    - Oblivion
    - Chaos
    - Life
    - War
    - Righteousness
    - Science
    - Death
    - Evil

  # List of weekday names used in your fictional calendar.
  # The total number of weekdays in your cycle is determined by the number of items in this list.
  # The plugin calculates the current weekday by taking the total fictional days passed modulo the size of this list.
  weekdays:
    - Anth
    - Asmo
    - Roth
    - Lull
    - Sil
    - Varth
    - Theyim
